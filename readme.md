This is a git repository made as part of a computational content analysis project
investigating which identity groups use 4chan's /lgbt/ board, and how.

As of now I'm at the data collection stage. I have a web scraper (`code/4chan_scrape.py`)
that is called every hour from a local device to scrape 4chan and then push the
results to this repo in `data/lgbt_week_1.csv`. This strategic (mis)use of 
github will lead to an amusing number of commits to this repository from my
account, but -- as it's the most convenient and expedient way for me to automate
my web scraping -- I'm just running with it.

I expect to conclude my scrapeing after a week or three, at which time it 
will _also_ be the moment for me to start more formal data analysis. Expect
updates here.
