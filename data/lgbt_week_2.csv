Help me understand trans lore,34634098,Anonymous,02/12/24,10:15:27,"Ultimately what you have to understand about 'trans lore' is that there are a very large number of different conceptions within the trans community about what being a man means or being a woman means or what changing ones gender or changing ones sex actually means or looks like. Giving a solid rigid definition to any of these often sparks infighting. I can give you my personal anecdotes about why I transitioned and why I feel Im a woman and not a man, but then any random trans person would potentially be offended by it and felt spoken over.My personal experience is I was basically assigned Eunuch at Birth. My whole life I consistently failed to biologically reflect what people would expect from a man, and people would project it onto me anyway. I remember being like 14 arguing with my mom, she said all men are stronger than all women no exception. Considering I literally did not have the chemicals needed to produce muscle or bone density and despite working out frequently was still weaker than my own mother. At some point, the rigidity of biological sex became pretty meaningless to me. It was clear that ones hormonal profile has a significant effect on their biology and the way the world interacts with them. From my perspective, if youre not partaking in breeding, male and females only meaning are ones hormonal profile. And I ended up trying both and hating T and regretting I ever touched it.But its different for most other trans people I talk to. Some are focussed on hormones like I am. Some are foxussed on 'the social role' and take hormones because they feel thats the only way society will let them participate in said social role. Some do not believe that male and female are different at all and that labels are just a vibe. Some believe their uttmost desire to be a woman is their womanhood. Theres so many different models.","Ultimately what you have to understand about 'trans lore' is that there are a very large number of different conceptions within the trans community about what being a man means or being a woman means or what changing ones gender or changing ones sex actually means or looks like. Giving a solid rigid definition to any of these often sparks infighting.

She would have friends call and text me.So I dated her through senior year of college.Then I moved from the east coast to the west coast (US). I told her I was gonna see other people. She moved to the same state, although several hours away. She still visited me a couple times a month until I told her the new girl I was dating wanted to be exclusive and that I truly couldn't see her anymore. That's how long it took her to recognize it. The next day she moved to another country.That's how conflict-avoidant I was.I lost so many dating opportunities with girls (and one guy lol) I was actually into. I still find it difficult to tell if I actually want to be in any relationship I find myself in, and I am in my 30s. You will NEVER be able to just convince her that the relationship should end simply by discussing it politely. Just won't happen. Just text her, explaining that you've already tried to end it in person and that she didn't accept it and there's nothing more you can do.

I'm not a virgin but I've had basically a handful of sexual encounters and even fewer that actually felt good. I'm not ugly I'm just unremarkable. people never show any interest in me. I just feel very alone and I wish I could meet who recognizes something valuable in me or who has experienced similar feelings. The ""final straw"" was just me understanding that i can't live my whole life for my parents approval. I did so bad in grad school and in some desperate attempt to make some kind of deeper connection i asked out a friend from undergrad that i always had feelings for. I still think she is a great person who is so smart and kind and honest. The whole thing was a misunderstanding. She already had someone and my confessions of love were less direct than i thought they were. But anyways the whole experience of realizing the miscommunication still hurt me so much. It just seems like there are infinitely more guys like me then people actually interested in dating guys like me and those guys are probably slightly better anyways. They probably don't carry so much self loathing and probably aren't so clingy. Idk how many times i have the fantasy of being in a relationship but it be like some kind of monkey's paw situation where the person turns out to be abusive and basically convinces me that I can't do any better so i just stick with someone who makes me feel like shit because I'm too afraid of going back to being alone.
