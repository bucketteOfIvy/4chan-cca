Those who practice homosexual acts are at least 12 times more apt to molest a child sexually, and with suitable corrections for bisexuals (who molest both genders), probably at least 16 times more apt to molest a child. A review of recorded cases of teacher-pupil sexual interaction indicated that of the 30 instances detailed in the literature, 24 (80 percent) involved homosexual acts. It appears that teachers who practice homosexual acts are between 90 to 100 times more apt to involve themselves sexually with pupils than teachers who confine themselves to heterosexual acts.\"https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/homosexual-molestation-childrensexual-interaction-teacher-and-pupil\n        "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No"}]}
