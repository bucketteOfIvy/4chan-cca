Indeed, unless one makes a grift of resisting or lampooning it (that's fine), it's otherwise profitable to actively front-run it. Translated from trollspeak, the basic point is that the opinions of smart people are almost always correct, and even when they are wrong on the details (e.g. the more lurid prewar Western media tropes on Russia; race differences in IQ), they are correct on the generalities (e.g. reality of ; HBD as infohazard and broad ultimate irrelevance in the age of accelerating AI), and you will not build reputational capital betting against this elite human capital. The reason is the same reason you can't win betting against ""smart money"" in markets, you have no ""alpha"" against them.If anything, the trick seems to consist of front-running them, i.e. by guesstimating where it goes next. There are low hanging fruit, e.g. implicit patriarchy of Anglo women being expected to adopt partner's name. There are bolder statements, such as carnivorism and national borders inevitably coming to be viewed as moral abominations by descendants. Transhumanist maximalism is in general a safe bet. At the broadest meta level, elite human capital welcomes increased competition over restrictions of any kind, this being ultimately in its own self-interests, as it views economies of scale from universalism as being in its own interests being confident in its own capacity to remain at the top of the human antheap.FTR, I certainly do not presume to belong to elite human capital. I identify as an ""object"" or ""thing"" that tries to observe and study its ways and trajectory.One has no obligation to attach any weight to a thing's opinions, so this is a much comfier position.","
Morality is defined by wherever elite human capital is trending, and the sooner you make your peace with that, the happier you will be. Indeed, unless one makes a grift of resisting or lampooning it (that's fine), it's otherwise profitable to actively front-run it. Translated from trollspeak, the basic point is that the opinions of smart people are almost always correct, and even when they are wrong on the details (e.g. the more lurid prewar Western media tropes on Russia; race differences in IQ), they are correct on the generalities (e.g. reality of ; HBD as infohazard and broad ultimate irrelevance in the age of accelerating AI), and you will not build reputational capital betting against this elite human capital. The reason is the same reason you can't win betting against ""smart money"" in markets, you have no ""alpha"" against them.If anything, the trick seems to consist of front-running them, i.e. by guesstimating where it goes next. There are low hanging fruit, e.g. implicit patriarchy of Anglo women being expected to adopt partner's name. There are bolder statements, such as carnivorism and national borders inevitably coming to be viewed as moral abominations by descendants. Transhumanist maximalism is in general a safe bet. At the broadest meta level, elite human capital welcomes increased competition over restrictions of any kind, this being ultimately in its own self-interests, as it views economies of scale from universalism as being in its own interests being confident in its own capacity to remain at the top of the human antheap.FTR, I certainly do not presume to belong to elite human capital. I identify as an ""object"" or ""thing"" that tries to observe and study its ways and trajectory.One has no obligation to attach any weight to a thing's opinions, so this is a much comfier position.",['>>34525076'],"['.', '.', '', '.', '.', '', '']"

I feel like I left out some important context for my post. The water in my apartment has recently been causing weird rashes to appear all over my skin. I went to the doctor about this and I got some sort of anti fungal/bacterial cream to use. Obviously it didn't work and the water kept causing rashes to appear. I am scared of this because constant rashes mean constant inflammation which means cancer (I am a hypochondriac). So basically I am terrified of the water in my apartment and don't know what the fuck to do. I haven't showered in a month but it used to be bad even before this, this just exacerbated my issue",['>>34542491'],[]

You have no idea whether you were even exposed to those hormones in the womb, you are just assuming you were and validating your delusions based on it. You wouldn't have testosterone and a male body if you were meant to be female. If you had Klinefelters or XXY chromosomes or something, that's a different story. if you look like other men, your body is in no way deformed, you just think it is, due to mental illness.

There is no way to tell for sure but it would make sense in hindsight, especially given other kinks I have pairing up with childhood events/trauma. Insecurity over being transfem and subconsciously overcorrecting in wanting to be traditionally feminine and submissive might also play a role.That would be the why. As for the how... can't explain it, it's just a huge turn on. The feeling of being complacent in my inability to defend myself. The idea of lacking agency somehow makes being humiliated and physically hurt enjoyable. There is fear and pain, but they somehow get turned into anticipation in a sexual setting. I've always been very shy and never been one to take control, so the idea of being completely subservient to someone playing the role of an abuser comes naturally to me. I recognize that it might logically make more sense to want to use someone for sexual pleasure than to be the one used. Something is just fucked in my brain, I guess. I like being hurt.","

It's definitely improving it just drives me insane how long it's taking, makes me feel gross. I look sorta like a boy besides the facial hair but like I feel like I almost look androgynous enough to get away with girlmoding if I had next to no facial hair.

Wondering if I should try to get some closer together or start electrolysis any time soon. It's just so icky... I want it off! Biggest source of dysphoria for sure.

A great deal of error is caused by mismanagement. Some however is just lack of experience or bad luck. So small failures that needs correcting but aren't actually harmful to anyone. A good manager would confront you with kind understanding, making you feel competent in spite of needing to learn. But you get it, these things, at least from how I understood you, still can hurt a great deal. I just don't want you to hurt.>You're making it sound like it's a sex thing.Aftercare I borrowed from degenerate terminology because I habe NO CLUE what the professional term is. But ultimately, most fears and anxieties can be trained into a weakened state. Like, arachnophobia, or even sociophobia, can be treated by exposing the person to the fear impulse. But not in a way that traumatizes them. Very carefully, very incrementally. It's like adjusting to hearing particular sounds or walking past particular landmarks until you stop noticing them. >No. I can't make friends because I fixate on slights and things that I don't understand.that is tricky, you def could use a support network, but trying to solve all things at once would only frustrate you so I have no qualms helping you tackle one thing after the other.

Sorry to hear, anon. Yeah, laptop is definitely tricky. I suppose the best thing I can suggest on that front is to make the device as dedicated as possible, its purpose is to communicate with your loved ones, think of it as a drop on replacement of an old fashioned wired phone.
It's difficult but it sounds like you are in the refeeding stage then already? That is wonderful news. It's damn hard.. I am rooting for you!

Hmm.. never had an ergonomic chair I think, but I remember that one really essential thing for me was fixing the height of the chair such that the things that should be level actually are. Also, laptops tend to be not great, using an external keyboard and raising the lapscreen top eye level is a good hack.","['>>34516699', '>>34522155', '>>34516333', '>>34522765', '>>34523070', '>>34523586', '>>34526217', '>>34526740']",[]
