I'm sure they wouldn't mind your manly smell and chiseled body at all, since it's just some friendly skinship between two brothers-in-arms.

>I don't need that if I do shit correctly, which I can do when people aren't giving me dogshit nebulous instructions.On the one hand, you are absolutely correct. A great deal of error is caused by mismanagement. Some however is just lack of experience or bad luck. So small failures that needs correcting but aren't actually harmful to anyone. A good manager would confront you with kind understanding, making you feel competent in spite of needing to learn.
