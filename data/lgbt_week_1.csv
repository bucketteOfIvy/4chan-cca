Cis women are able to insert a finger into their vagina to digitally manipulate impacted faeces and clear their rectal cavity. As I am sure everyone will experience occasionally in their lifetime, constipation can degrade quality of life; women's ability, therefore, to be able to manually extricate impacted shit out of their own arseholes is a major benefit for the fairer sex. My question is: does the latest cutting edge Indian sex reassignment surgeries allow trans women to manually evacuate impacted excrement from their rectum? Is digital manipulation of impacted shit accumulated in the anus of a transwoman through the artificial vaginal opening a high priority to medical researchers?

Aesthetically, not for the human rights. >AGP questions and answers>Thoughts and feelings / emotions>Help, advice, guidance>Be cozy and chill out>What is AGP?Autogynephilia, from Greek αὐτό- (""self""), γυνή (""woman"") and φιλία (""love"")Broadly, arousal to the thought of being a woman. It can take many forms - being aroused at imagining or seeing yourself with a female body, dressing in clothes that make you appear feminine, acting in stereotypical ""feminine"" ways, or others.>Isn't AGP just discredited pseudoscience?No, you might be thinking of Blanchard's Typology, which includes the idea of AGP. Regardless of whether or not you agree with Blanchard's ideas, AGP is very real to the people who experience it.>I'm AGP, does this mean I'm not trans?No, you can be AGP and trans.>Aren't you all just trannies in denial?Some people with AGP will go on to transition, while others are content with incorporating it into their sex life or simply the occasional indulgence. It varies greatly in intensity. If AGP consumes a lot of your mental energy or causes you lots of distress, it is probably worth asking more questions.Resources:>Why Gender Matters, the Emerging Science of Sex Differenceshttps://ia802804.us.archive.org/30/items/LeonardSaxWhyGenderMatters/Leonard%20Sax%20-%20Why%20Gender%20Matters.pdf#page171>The Gender Variant Phenomenon:https://www.avitale.com/essays/a-developmental-reviewCompilation of AGP books and studies: https://pastebin.com/dRQvi2K7",">qott: What period of history would you like to live as a woman in? Aesthetically, not for the human rights. >AGP questions and answers>Thoughts and feelings / emotions>Help, advice, guidance>Be cozy and chill out>What is AGP?Autogynephilia, from Greek αὐτό- (""self""), γυνή (""woman"") and φιλία (""love"")Broadly, arousal to the thought of being a woman. It can take many forms - being aroused at imagining or seeing yourself with a female body, dressing in clothes that make you appear feminine, acting in stereotypical ""feminine"" ways, or others.>Isn't AGP just discredited pseudoscience?No, you might be thinking of Blanchard's Typology, which includes the idea of AGP. Regardless of whether or not you agree with Blanchard's ideas, AGP is very real to the people who experience it.>I'm AGP, does this mean I'm not trans?No, you can be AGP and trans.>Aren't you all just trannies in denial?Some people with AGP will go on to transition, while others are content with incorporating it into their sex life or simply the occasional indulgence.

If anything is destructive, it’d probably be dating a woman lol.For me, I don’t see being with a man or getting fucked by him as humiliating. I actually find the idea very beautiful and inspiring. I sorta get the appeal of another tranny, since they can relate to you and understand you, but I don’t think it would work for me. My romantic and sexual feelings are very self-centered and I don’t think I could ever love someone more then I love myself. They’d have to fulfill a specific emotional role for me and I think only a man can do that. Putting aside the whole “AGP vs female sexuality” debate, I definitely think it’s true that female sexuality is more self-centered then male sexuality. Women are loves for who they are, men are loves for what they do. I think since I already am in love with myself, if I chose a partner it would be a man who I loved for actions he’d do for me like providing for me and such.",['>>34499439'],['']

Thought it was silly, so ""repressed"" in a way, never talked about it because I didn't want to attract negative attention.Knew about trans people when I was around 16 but didn't understand what it meant, and I assumed I was different from them.Tried to be a ""tough guy"" at around that point. Baggy clothes/facial hair, and hot-head attitude whenever someone was up in my face. I assumed that I felt wrong as a man because I'm weak/lithe in comparaison to most men, and because ""men are expected to be strong"".Heard of hrt when I was maybe 22, but wrongly assumed that what I had was just a fetish and didn't look any further into it.I figured it's gender dysphoria at 26, last september. Actively repressing since, until I can get on hrt.I maybe could pass with ffs, but I don't like the idea of surgery so I'll probably stay a twinkhon forever.",['>>34508001'],"['', '', '', '']"

Even wearing a bra to work is so terrifying, I'm scared someone will notice, but also my boobs are getting kinda noticeable. It doesn't help that my therapist is kinda shit, and advises me to boymode until I can pass 100%. I'm convinced I won't pass until I girlmode and figure out what works, but I've never girlmoded. It doesn't make it better since I was fucking kicked out of my local LGBT Center as I was changing into girl clothes. It was so upsetting, I haven't even considered girlmoding since then.

I thought that hrt would help me cope with social dysphoria, but it's made it feel so much worse lol>I really want to get out of presenting male so I stop feeling like I have to hide something constantly.Me too!!! My bf really wants me to girlmode 100%, but I still feel very anxious girlmoding. Even wearing a bra to work is so terrifying, I'm scared someone will notice, but also my boobs are getting kinda noticeable. It doesn't help that my therapist is kinda shit, and advises me to boymode until I can pass 100%. I'm convinced I won't pass until I girlmode and figure out what works, but I've never girlmoded.

Some part of them wanted HRT, so they probably feel less bad about its effects than a trans person feels about their endogenous hormone, and they're on HRT for less time than a trans person is on their endogenous hormone, meaning their bodies aren't as damaged. As an MTF I sort of relate to AFAB detransitioners as I'm essentially a more extreme instance of this -- I've been on testosterone for much longer, and it was forced on me instead of being chosen by mePart of me thinks it would be based if we reminded people of this fact every time the topic of detransitioners comes up, but we really should have some way to figure out who isn't really trans without much more gatekeeping. We should put these people in their place every time they come up, but still find a way to reduce the number of people who incorrectly transition, because they're similar to us in that they effectively have a trans lite experience, and being trans really sucks","
I don't think it's really that hard to discern between who's trans and who's confused, just by asking about some hypothetical scenarios about attitudes toward HRT and being one sex or the otherDetransitioners make videos where they say stuff like ""I really did have gender dysphoria, don't question this"" but then describe something that isn't gender dysphoria, it's just something that feels similar, and they were implicitly encouraged by being part of some trans community, in addition to not being smart enough to realize that the hormone they're seeking will cause them discomfort, despite being informed of its effectsFor how much noise they make in the media, detransitioners have it really easy in terms of trans stuff. Some part of them wanted HRT, so they probably feel less bad about its effects than a trans person feels about their endogenous hormone, and they're on HRT for less time than a trans person is on their endogenous hormone, meaning their bodies aren't as damaged.
