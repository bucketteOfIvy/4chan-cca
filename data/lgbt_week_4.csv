Thanks for your swift response, b.>though these days i'm normally only having one on days that i work > i just haven't been able to bring myself to do it,So it is less a matter of time and more the tugging of your mind fighting you and keeping you from eating?>i'm not sure where my weight is at right now, haven't been to the doctor since whenever i posted about that and i don't have a scaleDo you have a coming appointment?>and i'm still taking my meds as i'm supposed tovery good, b! >idk i feel like i'm just rambling and i don't really know what else to say, but i recognize these aren't healthy patterns i just feel like i can't actually DO anything to fix itthe feeling of powerlessness is NORMAL, and any solution will need trial and error and will frequently fail INITIALLY. That is expected, it is part of healing, you are NOT BROKEN. Keep that in mind. You can heal. And failure/relapses are part of the process. You are doing beautifully ringing the alarm bells

And again I felt a disappointed they weren't as wide and deep as a previous one. And before work I also bought a box cutter. I didn't cut with the box cutter tonight but I did just put it up against my skin and mock the actions I would need. I just think about how much I want to hurt and maim myself. I fantasize that I cut myself so deep that I pass out. I'm sorry I'm being crazy psycho alot, I swear I'm not just attention seeking for sympathy. It's just that it's all so much and I'm trying to do it all; I don't want to be insane again because I don't want to lose all that I've worked for and what little I have. I'm just struggling to do it all alone, I'm scared, and my head gets so crowded I can't think but all I can do is think. And sometimes I just need a break from my head and all the thinking.

There are drugs etc that can assist weight loss, don't know if a dr would prescribe them.If you really want to lose weight faster just do more exercise or at a higher intensity.Also, remember having less mass because your stomach is empty isn't the same as not having fat, the goal of most weight loss is to get your body to look how you want more than to just be lighter (basically, don't get bogged down in the numbers, as hard as that can be).","['>>34740874', '>>34741183']","['', '', '', '', '']"

My partner is struggling with depression, so is one of my closest friends who was also close to my partner. For years I've been bearing the weight of both I really care about and have known for 10 YRS, trying my best to help them and losing sleep over them. But its really come to a head in the last month when said friend M had a suicide attempt. He is states away and theres nothing I can do to help. Meanwhile he is constantly venting his self-hatred and frustration with my partner, S, to me for letting their friendship degrade. S recently moved to my city, and after an 8 month break we started dating again. Only this time S is committed to being poly and has one other partner. Which was a change and hard adjustment but I've had no issues with jealousy and making clear Im mono if we dated again. But 6 months have past and the amount weve talked and done anything IRL or online has steadily decline to the point of 2-3 weeks. It's killing me watching the person I'm closest to and knows me pull away from me. I know they spend much more time with their other partner(also poly) than me. That was before 2 months ago when S told me their depression has come back. Im trying to be patient with them, I'm trying to be support the people closest to me, but it feels like its never enough. I'm crying most nights because my partner won't put in any effort to mend things with me when it's been very one-sided since we started dating again, and the other is an active suicide risk. I can't be a bitch and vent to my partner because they have it hard enough. I have to just suffer in silence and hope things get better. But neither seem to want to actively change and just wallow while my partner spends all their time avoiding problems with their newer partner. There's a joke here about trans women and emotional labor but I'm to tired to make it.","

All of which makes it way harder to get a large caloric surplus.This then means you're under less pressure to make drastic dietary changes overnight (which is what causes failure for a lot of people).Obviously there's no magic bullet and doing both diet + exercise is more effective but it's better to start by tackling a hill (in perhaps a literal sense) over tackling something that you've got immediate mental barriers in the way of.>>34770569re:gogginsHe's ex-navy-seal so it's a bit too ""moto"" at times imo.

Idk what you consider a lot of weight but having lost about 20kg (that I'd gained because of similar habits) you're better off starting with exercise first then diet.Two reasons1) less boredom eating as you're having to be active with your time2) You'll have less ""bad"" or down days if you've convinced your brain to make a load of endorphins from doing exercise.I started with cycling, I'll admit I probably had the advantage of liking cycling already (MTB specifically), but if you can devote 2 hours a day then you can go cycle cross country for like 20 miles fairly easily and you'll burn a significant amount of calories (it's going to vary but it's about 1000 iirc). All of which makes it way harder to get a large caloric surplus.This then means you're under less pressure to make drastic dietary changes overnight (which is what causes failure for a lot of people).Obviously there's no magic bullet and doing both diet + exercise is more effective but it's better to start by tackling a hill (in perhaps a literal sense) over tackling something that you've got immediate mental barriers in the way of.

It's scary, yes. You climbed out of a hole and are scared falling back in! That is NORMAL. It does not mean you will. You are doing wonderfully.> Am I a tranny? Why am I taking my meds? i wanted to be feminine but is this enough? Well I mean, is there any harm in it? When in doubt forget about labels and gravitate towards comfort. If the only thing making you uncomfortable is the word people give it, disregard the word I suppose. It sounds like even in your uncertainty you are making progress. For now, assume it is not too late. Keep pushing no matter what, it is too late when you sit in the bus to your first day at the army, not a day sooner. I am proud of you. One day you'll be too!
I do hope you find other tranners to hang out with.
I'm fond of it, too.
Happy half year anniversary, anon! Sure thing, though a very broad question. Is it that you are overthinking in the moment and fumbling, is it anxiety? If we know what gets in your way we can more easily address it directly.
Hmm.. I have a few suggestions then. If it is close enough to travel back to your current place, it is close enough to make a small weekend trip there, right? Why not explore the local letter salad scene on visits for now? I ask because your #1 drawback right now would be a sudden change with no safety net.

He's not an emotionless robot, but he can be pretty stoic and is one of those people that can remain level headed or controlled in crazy situations (unless there are roaches). But as you've seen, he can also be a little shit.
That's fair. I'm expressing myself badly, but I guess I was thinking that people like this probably wouldn't seek out romantic relationships if that wasn't considered the norm or expected. Kind of like how people who don't want kids wind up having kids. It's like they look at those things as ticking boxes without wondering if that's what they really want. So then people who want romantic relationships where the people like each other, share things together and aren't ""just making it work"" get hurt and then kids get dragged into it. It's ass. >I can't believe people are that dedicated to suffering for some squirt.That too.","['>>34820961', '>>34821132']",['']

I'm not sure how many of the people on here have experience with hypnosis and everything else but i'm sure at least the anon's replying and feeling all good and snug and happy are enjoying it. Hypnosis doesn't give anyone unnatural control, it's all about giving away control willingly, when growing warmer and happier and letting all the muscles go even looser and more limp than you thought possible, in the end it's you who decides to read on and feel good and obey, because why would you not want to feel good? Take a second to continue these slow breaths and while you're doing that, i just want you to imagine what being completely hypnotized would feel like. Given how you feel right now, imagine what it would feel like to be completely blank, to have absolutely no thoughts of your own, to completely follow along to these words, in a state of happy bliss, just following along, imagine how that would feel, reading and obeying, doing so well at imagining that. Doesn't that seem like something you would want? just like you've relaxed so far, but even better, even deeper, a wave of happiness for every word you follow? Maybe you could tell me how the thought of being hypnotized and following these words makes you feel.","



it's ok, to give yourself the permission to relax like this, i know how you enjoy feeling weak and pliable. I'm not sure how many of the people on here have experience with hypnosis and everything else but i'm sure at least the anon's replying and feeling all good and snug and happy are enjoying it. Hypnosis doesn't give anyone unnatural control, it's all about giving away control willingly, when growing warmer and happier and letting all the muscles go even looser and more limp than you thought possible, in the end it's you who decides to read on and feel good and obey, because why would you not want to feel good? Take a second to continue these slow breaths and while you're doing that, i just want you to imagine what being completely hypnotized would feel like. Given how you feel right now, imagine what it would feel like to be completely blank, to have absolutely no thoughts of your own, to completely follow along to these words, in a state of happy bliss, just following along, imagine how that would feel, reading and obeying, doing so well at imagining that. Doesn't that seem like something you would want? just like you've relaxed so far, but even better, even deeper, a wave of happiness for every word you follow? Maybe you could tell me how the thought of being hypnotized and following these words makes you feel.","['>>34822310', '>>34822946', '>>34822954', '>>34822974']",[]

Jewishness is one of the few things that doesn't get mashed into the homogeneous pulp, its a ground an anchor in this world, a real culture & community which most people, especially white people in the first world suburbs, do not have. The elites will not stop until everyone is in a pod, without a community, but jewish communities will survive that, so the elites (who are mostly anglos like the pilgrim's society) gives them the highest income jobs to keep them onside.This may sound like an anti-semitic conspiracy theory but unlike /pol/acks I don't think globalised homogeneity is 100% bad- the individualism globo-homo has promoted its the reason trannies can live in the west without being persecuted.

Me too- they think they're so much better than the unwashed and paticular-cultured, because they've integrated into globo-homo (except the ultra orthodox)- this is why both /pol/acks and black people hate them: they're both anti globalised homogeneity. Jewishness is one of the few things that doesn't get mashed into the homogeneous pulp, its a ground an anchor in this world, a real culture & community which most people, especially white people in the first world suburbs, do not have.

Do you want the law banning female genital mutilation to be repealed so that parents can genitally mutilate their daughters just as they can their sons’ genitals? You’re genuinely a sexist piece of shit. You would actively deny males the same legal protections that females enjoy. Both male genital mutilation and female genital mutilation should be rightfully banned. And intactivists are right to call for a total ban on genital mutilation NOW rather than waiting for whatever moment in time you’re thinking of.",['>>34793577'],['']

But don't listen to their stories. Listen to older trans women. Men are happy to humor us when they're young, when they're not in a hurry to start a family. They do have a biological clock of their own, it's just delayed compared with women. I can't speak to trans and cis lesbian relationships, as I don't have an interest in women and know nothing about that scene. Again however, you should look to older trans women in these situations. Are they with a cis partner, or a trans partner? Historically, and this is true in other cultures as well, we usually were in a social ghetto, forced to care for one another, and find comfort in one another. It's especially unfortunate for me, because I have no sexual attraction to other trans women. I see however that, as I'm getting older, there isn't going to be a choice. If I want romantic companionship, I'm going to have to look to the pool of my own kind. It's unfortunate, but it is what it is.","Yup.

Sure, they might set some filter to a certain height, but that's mostly because the option is there and not really because it's what they truly want. So basically, git gud and don't stress about height. If they care, they aren't worth dating in the first place. If they dont care, then you're on even footing with every other guy. Stop being angry incels and women will naturally be attracted to you. You'd be genuinely amazed how much a positive and confident attitude will turn a woman on","

As a practical matter, it would be better to thin the Amerikkkansout, making them minorities in the Third World, where they could easily be controlled and supervised by the international proletariat. 2) Amerikkkans will need to undergo re-education. It would be very difficult to re-educate them in their own kkkountry. They need to be in a proletarian environment where they can learn from the masses. 3) There are land claims to settle, mainly for the First Nations, but also for Aztlán and perhaps the Black nation. Conceivably some other nations could be moved to North America if they wished to be, such as Nauru or the small nations in Ghana whose land has been ruined by imperialist corporations. Amerikkkans are going to have to move out of much of North America and make room for other nations. 4) Amerikkkan kkkulture is almost totally reactionary. There is little worth saving in Amerikkkan kkkulture. It would be better to force Amerikkkans to assimilate to the more culturally and politically advanced peoples of the Third World. There is also historic justice in forcing Amerikkkans to assimilate, just as they destroyed so many other nations and cultures.5) In the early stages of socialism, the Third World will require skilled workers and technicians of various kinds, including medical personnel.

The toxic cancer causing chemicals are nicotine along with other carcinogens that are produced when something creates smoke. Inhaling said chemicals means you inhale said chemicals. I don't think smoking American Spirits vs. Other cigs reduces the cancerous molecules I ingest. What American Spirits do is give me a better smoking experience.

There's no point you can't come back from if this is you, and I wanted to come back to this place I spent so much time years ago to offer help to those who might want it. I began my transition socially at the age of 15, and medically at the age of 19. I thought it was the right move as long as I knew what transition was. Once I was out of my parents' house, I took hormones while living at university and came back looking female. I didn't pass at first when I was on the pills, as I don't think the E absorbed very well, but once I switched to injections I passed completely. No one at my work looked at me twice, no one at school acted differently towards me, I was basically done. I still wasn't happy though. I knew deep down that I'd only approach or imitate femaleness. I tried to bury those feelings in copious amounts of weed, psychedelics, and other forms of escapism, but eventually it caught up with me. Four and a half years in, I knew I had to stop, and face the male form I had been running from. This was one year ago today.Over the past year, I stopped taking HRT, recovered natural T levels without supplementation, and have been hitting the gym to make up for all the muscle I shed on E. I'm a thousand times happier, and now I'm able to do things like consider romantic relationships without worrying about being harmed, I can go to gendered spaces without worrying about passing or being singled out, and I don't have to hide myself from others. I understand that for some people, transition does work better than facing whatever mental health issues caused it head on. Some of my best friends are in that camp. If you have questions or if you want to call me a faggot, feel free to.","It's not too late to come back. Men and women alike have been swept up in the posthumanist tide of transition, and with how easy it is to access HRT if you want it, it's inevitable it won't be the right decision for some people.

That said, their website runs great, they seem to know what they're doing, and Libby works great for interacting with QLL's collection. My local library system also uses Libby and has pretty good queer representation, so if I'm browsing in the QLL and see something that has a waitlist I can just search my local libraries and sometimes find an available copy there. The audiobooks are particularly nice because I can listen to a romance novel or a book about queer experiences or healthcare while sharpening a bayonet, studying Google Maps or loading AR magazines.I think the biggest plus to the QLL project is that people who live in backwards, soon-to-be-destroyed Christofascist states have access to a wide range of LGBTQIA+ media which wouldn't otherwise be available to them.So yeah!
